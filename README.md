- The Connecticut data is for Connecticut counties, not the recently created Connecticut planning regions
- The population data for the now non-existent Valdez-Cordova Census Region in Alaska is the combined populations (in the 2020 census) for the Copper River Census Area and the Chugach Census Area, the two successors of the Valdez-Cordova Census Region.
